# Code-Analy

Intelligent Code Analysis & Refactoring MCP Server

## Overview

Code-Analy is a comprehensive MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables AI agents to analyze Python codebases, detect code smells, suggest intelligent refactorings, and apply automated code transformations. It uses AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) based analysis combined with AI-powered suggestions to provide deep code insights.

## Features

### 1. Comprehensive Code Smell Detection

Detects **6 types** of code smells:

1. **Too Many Parameters (>5)**
   - Identifies functions with more than 5 parameters (excluding `self`/`cls`)
   - Helps maintain code readability and reduce complexity

2. **Unused Imports**
   - Finds imports that are declared but never used
   - Helps keep code clean and reduce dependencies

3. **Dead Code**
   - Identifies unreachable code after return, raise, break, or continue statements
   - Improves code quality and maintainability

4. **Long Methods (>50 lines)**
   - Detects functions that are too long and difficult to maintain
   - Encourages breaking down complex logic into smaller functions

5. **Deep Nesting (>3 levels)**
   - Identifies deeply nested control structures
   - Promotes flatter, more readable code

6. **Duplicate Code Blocks**
   - Finds repeated code patterns across the codebase
   - Encourages DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles

### 2. AI-Powered Refactoring Suggestions

- **LLM Integration**: Supports OpenAI GPT-4 and Anthropic Claude APIs
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Understands code patterns and suggests appropriate refactorings
- **Detailed Recommendations**: Provides specific examples with before/after code
- **Reasoning**: Explains why each refactoring is beneficial
- **Categorization**: Groups suggestions by complexity, readability, maintainability, and cleanliness
- **Priority Levels**: Ranks suggestions by importance (high, medium, low)

### 3. Automated Refactoring Operations

Safe, automated code transformations:

- **Remove Unused Imports**: Automatically clean up import statements
- **Rename Variables/Functions**: Intelligently rename identifiers throughout the code
- **Extract Methods**: Pull out code blocks into separate, reusable functions
- **Format Code**: Apply consistent formatting rules (whitespace, blank lines, etc.)

### 4. Multi-File Support

- **Directory Analysis**: Scan entire projects recursively
- **Dependency Tracking**: Identify relationships between files
- **Project-Level Insights**: Generate comprehensive reports with statistics
- **Scalable**: Handles codebases of any size

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# Install development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Optional: Install AI providers for advanced suggestions
pip install openai anthropic
```

## Usage

### Running the MCP Server

```bash
python -m code_analy.server
```

### Available MCP Tools

The server exposes the following tools through the MCP protocol:

1. **analyze_code** - Comprehensive analysis detecting all types of issues
2. **detect_code_smells** - Focused code smell detection
3. **suggest_refactoring** - AI-powered refactoring suggestions (requires API key)
4. **apply_refactoring** - Apply automated code transformations
5. **analyze_directory** - Analyze entire projects
6. **check_function_parameters** - Check for functions with too many parameters
7. **check_unused_imports** - Detect unused imports
8. **check_dead_code** - Find unreachable code

### Python API Examples

#### Detect All Code Smells

```python
from code_analy.analyzer import analyze_code

source = """
import os
import sys

def process_data(a, b, c, d, e, f):
    print(sys.version)
    return a + b
    print("This won't execute")
"""

issues = analyze_code(source)
for issue in issues:
    print(f"{issue['type']} at line {issue['line']}: {issue['message']}")
```

#### Get AI-Powered Suggestions

```python
from code_analy.ai_analyzer import AIAnalyzer
from code_analy.analyzer import analyze_code

# Analyze code first
issues = analyze_code(source_code)

# Get AI suggestions (using mock mode for testing)
ai = AIAnalyzer(provider="mock")
suggestions = ai.suggest_refactorings(source_code, issues)

for s in suggestions:
    print(f"{s.title}")
    print(f"Reasoning: {s.reasoning}")
    print(f"Before: {s.code_before}")
    print(f"After: {s.code_after}")
```

#### Apply Automated Refactoring

```python
from code_analy.refactor import apply_refactoring

# Remove unused imports
result = apply_refactoring(
    source_code,
    "remove_unused_imports",
    unused_imports=["os"]
)

# Rename variable
result = apply_refactoring(
    source_code,
    "rename_variable",
    old_name="tmp",
    new_name="total"
)

# Extract method
result = apply_refactoring(
    source_code,
    "extract_method",
    start_line=5,
    end_line=10,
    method_name="helper_function"
)

# Format code
result = apply_refactoring(source_code, "format_code")

print(result['refactored_code'])
```

#### Analyze Entire Directory

```python
from code_analy.multi_file import analyze_directory

results = analyze_directory("./my_project", recursive=True)

print(f"Total files: {results['total_files']}")
print(f"Total issues: {results['total_issues']}")
print(f"Summary: {results['summary']}")
```

## Configuration

### AI Provider Setup

To use AI-powered suggestions with real LLM APIs:

```bash
# For OpenAI
export LLM_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"

# Or for Anthropic
export LLM_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key"
```

Then specify the provider when creating the analyzer:

```python
# Using OpenAI
ai = AIAnalyzer(provider="openai")

# Using Anthropic
ai = AIAnalyzer(provider="anthropic")

# Using mock (for testing, no API key needed)
ai = AIAnalyzer(provider="mock")
```

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

The test suite includes 29+ test cases covering:
- All 5 types of code smell detection
- AI-powered suggestion generation
- Automated refactoring operations
- Multi-file analysis
- Edge cases and error handling

## Demo

Run the comprehensive demo to see all features in action:

```bash
python demo_all_features.py
