SOLUTION: Test Code Configuration Clarification
================================================================================

ORIGINAL QUESTION:
"is the testing hardcoded or i can change the test code and it shows me the issues"

ANSWER:
--------
✅ YES - Tests ARE hardcoded (but only for validation)
✅ NO - You DON'T need to change the tests
✅ YES - You CAN analyze ANY Python code you want!

HOW TO ANALYZE YOUR OWN CODE:
------------------------------

Option 1: Command-Line Tool (Easiest!)
   python analyze_your_code.py your_file.py
   python analyze_your_code.py your_project/

Option 2: Python API
   from code_analy.analyzer import analyze_code
   issues = analyze_code(your_source_code)

Option 3: MCP Server
   python -m code_analy.server
   # Then send YOUR code to analyze

UNDERSTANDING THE DISTINCTION:
------------------------------

Tests (tests/)          vs      Your Code Analysis
- Hardcoded snippets           - ANY Python code
- Validate tool works          - Find real issues  
- DON'T modify these          - Create your own scripts
- Example: test_*.py          - Example: your_app.py

DOCUMENTATION ADDED:
--------------------
📖 FAQ.md - "Can I change test code?" (Answer: You don't need to!)
📖 QUICKSTART.md - Get started in 60 seconds
📖 UNDERSTANDING.md - Visual guide showing the difference
📖 README.md - Updated with warnings and quick links

TOOLS PROVIDED:
---------------
🔧 analyze_your_code.py - CLI tool for analyzing your files
📝 sample_code.py - Example code to analyze
⚙️  config.py - Customize detection settings
🎭 demo_flexibility.py - Interactive demonstration

QUICK START:
------------
1. python analyze_your_code.py sample_code.py    # Test with sample
2. python analyze_your_code.py YOUR_FILE.py      # Analyze your code!
3. Read FAQ.md for more options

KEY TAKEAWAY:
-------------
Think of Code-Analy like a spell checker:
- Tests verify it catches "teh" → "the" 
- You use it on YOUR documents
- You don't edit the spell checker tests
- You write whatever document you want!

Same with Code-Analy:
- Tests verify it detects code issues correctly
- You use it on YOUR Python code
- You don't edit Code-Analy tests  
- You analyze whatever code you want!

ALL FILES:
----------
✅ 8 new documentation/tool files added
✅ 1 existing file updated (README.md)
✅ All 29 tests still pass
✅ Zero security issues
✅ Code review feedback addressed

WHAT'S BEEN CLARIFIED:
----------------------
Before: "I think the tests limit what I can analyze"
After:  "Tests validate the tool; I can analyze ANY code!"

The tests are the PROOF that the analyzer works.
YOUR code is the SUBJECT you want to analyze.
